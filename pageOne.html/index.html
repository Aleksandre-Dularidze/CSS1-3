		<h2 id="bigHeader">BIG BANG THEORY</h2>
		<p id="pLong">This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evolution
			of the universe. The Big Bang theory suggests that the history of the
			universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago. As a result of the Big Bang,
			time, space, and all matter were created, leading to the expansion of the cosmos.</p>

			<h2 id="holeBox">black hole theory</h2>
			<div id="fixP">
				<p id="blackP">Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. These are regions
					where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape.
					Black holes interact with nearby matter and can emit radiation.</p>

			<h2 id="stringH">string theory</h2>
			<div id="pinkBox">
				<p id="pinkP">String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description of the physical world.
					According to this theory, we live in a three-dimensional space on Earth, but the
					cosmos might contain additional microscopic, non-material "strings" (vibrating
					filaments) that are part of confined spaces with different sizes and characteristics.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Here are three key points about String Theory:</h3>
			<div id="listBox">
				<ul>
					<li id="listItem">Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks to provide a
						single framework that explains all fundamental forces and particles
						in the universe, including gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.</li>
					<li id="listTwo">Extra Dimensions: While we experience a three-dimensional space, string theory
						proposes the existence of additional microscopic dimensions that are
						compactified, potentially influencing the laws of physics.</li>
					<li id="listThree">Vibrating Strings: According to string theory, the fundamental building
						blocks of matter are not point-like particles but rather one-dimensional
						"strings" that vibrate at different frequencies, with each vibration
						corresponding to a different particle type.</li>
